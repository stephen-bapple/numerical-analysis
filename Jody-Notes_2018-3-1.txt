- 2: book discussion choice.
    - Choose one.
    - Or choose two
    - Or choose three
    - It's your party, cry if you want to
    
    
Encouragement time:
    - It's only been 4 weeks! You started from scratch! :)
    
Learning objectives:
    - other places may measure productivity via LOC or bugs fixed
        - This is not the metric this class is using.
        - Task is to be a learner and a reflector.
    
    - Not as much time as it seams.
        - Don't be discouraged
        - Do try to still make progress
        - Keep in mind LEARNING objectives.
        
We are doing this here now so that it's NOT the first time you see this.
